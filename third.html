There's so much that I have been feeling since I heard the news about sushant's demise.
I am not able to express even half of what I am feeling .Sushant - you were a gem , a intelligent young man with a bundle of talents.
A month after your death I am still reeling, as are so many of your fans, friends, work colleagues and acquaintances. I cannot imagine the grief of your loved ones.
But you were grieving as well. A very evident twitter profile picture hinting at thoughts of depression ,millions of followers yet no one to notice your well being.
There was something so humane and charming side of you which clearly Bollywood doesn't deserve it. It makes me ponder on how every life in film industry 
is merely looked as a commodity . With so many battles you were fighting inside alone and unknown , your acting was just the tip of iceberg of what you truly are.
Posing for the paps, with the street kids with utmost humility and appreciating young talents , I mean who does that .</p>
<br>
<p>Coming to the films , the first time I saw M.S Dhoni , I was truly stunned to see how much you are under his skin. So effortless. Dedicated to your training sessions just to
perfect the batting style or master the helicopter shot speakes volumes about how inclined you are to profession. You are shy, extreme introvert but 
everytime you smile sushant you have captured millions of heart. I am still pondering on how a AIR 7 rank student with deep knowledge in astrophysics
can die by suicide.Your search was existential, as much for the meaning of life, as for the reason of your mums death while you were still a teen.
</p>
<br>
<p> I wish you had reached out to many other people who would have made you realise the accomplishments you made, the performances you delivered
and the love and respect they had for you in their hearts. I am sure each one of them would have made you realise your worth and your sweet smile.
As you looked avidly through your telescope, I wish that a star in your life would have encouraged and suppress the negative thoughts.
You are leaving a legacy behind - a unique one.Thank you for being you .Wish we could have treated you better infact fairer . RIP<br><br>
